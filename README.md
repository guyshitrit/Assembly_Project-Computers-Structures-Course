**Program Overview:** 
Array Management Using Syscalls
This program is designed to maintain a static array of integers with a size between 0 and 30 elements, each of which occupies a single word (WORD).
The elements represent signed numbers, and the memory allocated for the array will be efficiently managed using system calls, specifically syscall 1 and syscall 5.
The program will provide a menu-driven interface to perform various operations on the array.

**Menu Options:**
When the program starts, a menu will be displayed, providing the following options for the user:
1. Enter a number (base 10)
2. Replace a number (base 10)
3. Delete a number (base 10)
4. Find a number in the array (base 10)
5. Find the average of array elements (base 2-10)
6. Find the maximum value in the array (base 2-10)
7. Print all array elements (base 2-10)
8. Print sorted array elements (base 2-10)
9. End the program
